## Course Policies

## Assignments

UMBC provides a range of writing assistance, which can be found in the following:

- The Writing Center: http://lrc.umbc.edu/tutor/writing-center/

- Research Guides & Tutorials: http://lib.guides.umbc.edu/tutorial

Failure to follow guidelines for each assignment, including the required format, style, length, and submission may result in at least one-letter-grade reduction on the assignment depending on the type or number of transgressions.

## Late Assignments

### NO late/incomplete assignments will be accepted! Emergency situations will be handled on a case by case basis with appropriate justification and/or documentation.

Incomplete grades are granted only for extenuating circumstances and your request is made before the last - Week of class.

## Academic Integrity

If published work produced by someone else is used, cite the contribution in your assignment submission. If a website is referenced, specify the full URL of the source. If your own work from a previous or concurrent course is used, specify that in the assignment submission.  Uncited references for software code and essays is plagiarism. 

Discussion of assignments with other students is not allowed until all work associated with that assignment has been graded. __Submit your own independent work.__ __Sharing of work is not acceptable.__ Explaining your approach to other students must wait until everyone has a grade for their assignment.
If plagiarism is an issue, the instructor of the course can select from a range of penalty responses. Examples include a written warning (registered with UMBC’s administrators), assigning a zero for the submitted work, decreasing the course score by less than a letter grade, decreasing the course grade by 1 or more letter grades, or assigning an F for the course grade.

By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UMBC’s scholarly community in which everyone’s academic work and behavior are held to the highest standards of honesty.  Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and helping other to commit these acts are all forms of academic dishonesty, and they are wrong.  Academic misconduct could result in disciplinary action that may include, but is not limited to failure, suspension or dismissal.  

Refer to the UMBC policy on Academic Integrity: http://catalog.umbc.edu/content.php?catoid=17&navoid=879#academic-integrity.
Student Academic Misconduct in the Grad School is handled by the Associate Dean of the Grad School. The first step is for the instructor to consult with the AD. If the instructor and AD determine that a less serious infraction has occurred, then the AD provides written authority to the instructor to resolve the matter. The instructor then notifies the students in writing, and the students must be allowed the opportunity to provide an explanation. The student has the right to appeal the decision directly to the AD, and the student must be informed of this right. If an appeal is requested, then the AD will convene a Grievance Committee under the policy established by University of Maryland Graduate School, Baltimore (UMGSB).
Incidents are tracked by UMBC. Repeated infractions incur more severe penalties. 

Use of 
  * any artificial technical assistance (i.e., ChatGPT or other generative technologies) outside of onboard spellcheck and things like Google Scholar, academic library databases, or reference managers and 
  * solutions/projects found on the internet are considered academic misconducts and strictly forbidden. If your solutions or reports are determined to be in this category, then you will receive 0 (zero) for that assignment/project.


## Accessibility and Disability Accommodations, Guidance and Resources 
Accommodations for students with disabilities are provided for all students with a qualified disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA & ADAAA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act who request and are eligible for accommodations. The Office of Student Disability Services (SDS) is the UMBC department designated to coordinate accommodations that creates equal access for students when barriers to participation exist in University courses, programs, or activities.

If you have a documented disability and need to request academic accommodations in your courses, please refer to the SDS website at sds.umbc.edu for registration information and office procedures.

SDS email: disAbility@umbc.edu

If you will be using SDS approved accommodations in this class, please contact the instructor to discuss implementation of the accommodations. During remote instruction requirements due to COVID, communication and flexibility will be essential for success.

## Sexual Assault, Sexual Harassment, and Gender Based Violence and Discrimination 
UMBC Policy in addition to federal and state law (to include Title IX) prohibits discrimination and harassment on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity in University programs and activities. Any student who is impacted by sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, sexual exploitation, gender discrimination, pregnancy discrimination, gender-based harassment, or related retaliation should contact the University’s Title IX Coordinator to make a report and/or access support and resources. The Title IX Coordinator can be reached at titleixcoordinator@umbc.edu or 410-455-1717.

You can access support and resources even if you do not want to take any further action. You will not be forced to file a formal complaint or police report. Please be aware that the University may take action on its own if essential to protect the safety of the community.

If you are interested in making a report, please use the Online Reporting/Referral Form.  Please note that, if you report anonymously, the University’s ability to respond will be limited.

### Notice that Faculty and Teaching Assistants are Responsible Employees with Mandatory Reporting Obligations

All faculty members and teaching assistants are considered Responsible Employees, per UMBC’s Policy on Sexual Misconduct, Sexual Harassment, and Gender Discrimination. Faculty and teaching assistants therefore required to report all known information regarding alleged conduct that may be a violation of the Policy to the Title IX Coordinator, even if a student discloses an experience that occurred before attending UMBC and/or an incident that only involves people not affiliated with UMBC.  Reports are required regardless of the amount of detail provided and even in instances where support has already been offered or received.

While faculty members want to encourage you to share information related to your life experiences through discussion and written work, students should understand that faculty are required to report past and present sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic and dating violence, stalking, and gender discrimination that is shared with them to the Title IX Coordinator so that the University can inform students of their rights, resources, and support.  While you are encouraged to do so, you are not obligated to respond to outreach conducted as a result of a report to the Title IX Coordinator.

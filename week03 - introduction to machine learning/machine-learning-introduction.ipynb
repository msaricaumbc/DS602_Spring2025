    ">Vast amounts of data are being generated in many fields, and the statistician’s job is to make sense of it all: to extract import patterns and trends, and understand “what the data says.” We call this learning from data.\n",
    "<br><br>Hastie et al., The Elements of Statistical Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definion 2:\n",
    "> Machine learning is a subfield of computer science that is concerned with building algorithms which, to be useful, rely on a collection of examples of some phenomenon. These examples can come from nature, be handcrafted by humans or generated by another algorithm.\n",
    "<br><br>Burkov, The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition 3:\n",
    "> Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as \"training data\", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.\n",
    "<br><br>A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning. Some implementations of machine learning use data and neural networks in a way that mimics the working of a biological brain. In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.  \n",
